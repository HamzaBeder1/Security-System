# Home Security System

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to make a security system based on the Raspberry Pi 4 computer. This project will involve the following components:
* HC-SR501 PIR Sensor: detects motion and acts as a trigger to turn on the cameras.
* Raspberry Pi Camera Module: combined with OpenCV for facial recognition. If the face is unknown, then a SMS message is sent to the homeowner.
